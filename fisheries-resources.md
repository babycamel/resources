# A list of mostly R Fisheries Resources 

This is a list of mostly R packages and resources for fisheries. I've included some other materials including publicly avaialble notes on fisheries economics, and some non-R software fisheries managers as well as other resources.

[An introduction to basic fisheries analysis in R (UCSB)](https://sfg-ucsb.github.io/fishery-manageR/)

Fisheries economics:

[Gabriel Lozada. Notes on Fisheries Economics](https://content.csbs.utah.edu/~lozada/Adv_Resource_Econ/Pvtfish4.pdf)

This is a list of useful R packages for Fisheries:

[Fishy packages](http://derekogle.com/fishR/packages)

[The Fisheries library in R](http://www.flr-project.org/)

[The R package kobe](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kobe/index.html) Most likely one needs to install earlier versions as this currently appears to be unmaintained.

[FishR](http://derekogle.com/fishR/)

[TropFish R package](https://github.com/tokami/TropFishR)

[rfisheries access to the Openfisheries.org API](https://github.com/ropensci/rfisheries) This gives access to global fisheries catch and other data.

Fisheries stock assessment:

[FSA](https://github.com/droglenc/FSA)

[fishdynr](https://github.com/marchtaylor/fishdynr)

[multiStockAssessment](https://github.com/calbertsen/multi_SAM)


Fisheries Management:

[Generalised Management Strategy Evaluation (GMSE)](https://bradduthie.github.io/gmse/)

For Marine Protected areas this is the goto package:

[Marine Regions](https://recology.info/2016/06/marine-regions/)

Catchdynamics:

[CatDyn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CatDyn/)

[VMSbase](https://github.com/vmsbase/R-vmsbase)

[DLMtool: Data-Limited Methods Toolkit](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DLMtool/)

Oceanography: 

This provides access to the NOAA data API:

[noaaoceans](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/noaaoceans/index.html) 

Marmap is used for downloading and plotting marine bathymetric and topographic data:

[marmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marmap/index.html)

A PlosOne article about marmap [marmap: A Package for Importing, Plotting and Analyzing Bathymetric and Topographic Data in R](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073051)

## Other non-R resources
