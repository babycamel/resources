# A list of mostly R Fisheries Resources 

This is a list of mostly R packages and resources for fisheries. I've included some other materials including publicly available notes on fisheries economics, and some non-R software for fisheries managers as well as other resources.

[An introduction to basic fisheries analysis in R (UCSB)](https://sfg-ucsb.github.io/fishery-manageR/)

[Malcolm Haddon, Using R for Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries](https://haddonm.github.io/URMQMF/)

## Fisheries economics:

[Arne Eide, Introduction to Fisheries Economics](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/17585273) uses Mathematica

[my own notes, Notes on the Gordon-Schaefer Model (uses Python)](https://github.com/babycamel/afew/blob/master/notes-gordon-schaefer.pdf)

[Notes on Fisheries Economics, Lozada](https://content.csbs.utah.edu/~lozada/Adv_Resource_Econ/Pvtfish4.pdf)

### Oceanography: 

This provides access to the NOAA data API:

[noaaoceans](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/noaaoceans/index.html) 

Marmap is used for downloading and plotting marine bathymetric and topographic data:

[marmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marmap/index.html)

A PlosOne article about marmap [marmap: A Package for Importing, Plotting and Analyzing Bathymetric and Topographic Data in R](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073051)
